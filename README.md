## **Project description**
This repository contains the code written for a bachelor project at a higher education institution. The project aimed to create a website for a startup called Leap Glocal.

The goal of the project was to build a platform where startups could present themselves and connect with investors and other stakeholders. The website was to be built using a combination of PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, and PHP on the backend.

An important part of the project was to integrate a payment solution, which was intended to be Stripe. This was necessary to offer a free version of the platform for users with limited budgets, while generating revenue from paying users.

Unfortunately, the project was never completed, and the code in this repository represents only an incomplete version of the work that was done. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the code works as intended or that it is secure.

However, we hope that this repository can be useful for others working on similar projects and that it can inspire new ideas and solutions.
